                <p>Hannah Hauser started playing music when she joined the band program at her school. She started playing in the 
                percussion section during her 7th grade year and continued to play percussion all throughout the rest of public school 
                and even on to college. Sometime in her Junior year of high school she decided that she wanted to become a band director and
                continue her musical journey after she graduated high school. She went to a university a few hours away from her hometown
                and studied there for a bachelor's in music education for the next 4 years. In her junior year of college she decided that she
                wanted to take on a new challenge and audition for a drum corps. A drum corps is the most elite and prestigious form of a 
                marching band. Think about drum corps like you would a professional sport, it's the highest level at which you can perform
                and compete in marching band. Hannah auditioned for a group in Tennessee and after a few auditions, she made the corps! During that
                summer she toured around the country to perform and compete against other drum corps. In the spring of 2017, Hannah graduated
                and landed a teaching job near her hometown. During that first year teaching she also decided that she wanted to perform again
                and she auditioned for an indoor percussion ensemble named Gateway Percussion. She made that group as well and competed during the
                winter and spring season. With Hannah's immense performance background she was now sought after by many local schools and performing 
                ensembles to become their teacher. You can see a few of the groups she went on to teach in the table below.
